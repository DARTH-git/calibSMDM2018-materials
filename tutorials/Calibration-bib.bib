	abstract = {Background
Sexual mixing between heterogeneous population subgroups is an integral component of mathematical models of sexually transmitted infections ({STIs}). This study compares the fit of different mixing representations to survey data and the impact of different mixing assumptions on the predicted benefits of hypothetical human papillomavirus ({HPV}) vaccine strategies.
Methods
We compared novel empirical (data-driven) age mixing structures with the more commonly-used assortative-proportionate (A-P) mixing structure. The A-P mixing structure assumes that a proportion of sexual contacts – known as the assortativity constant, typically estimated from survey data or calibrated – occur exclusively within one’s own age group and the remainder mixes proportionately among all age groups. The empirical age mixing structure was estimated from the National Survey on Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles 3 (Natsal-3) using regression methods, and the assortativity constant was estimated from Natsal-3 as well. Using a simplified {HPV} transmission model under each mixing assumption, we calibrated the model to British {HPV}16 prevalence data, then estimated the reduction in steady-state prevalence and the number of infections averted due to expanding {HPV} vaccination from 12- through 26-year-old females alone to 12-year-old males or 27- to 39-year-old females.
Results
Empirical mixing provided a better fit to the Natsal-3 data than the best-fitting A-P structure. Using the model with empirical mixing as a reference, the model using the A-P structure often under- or over-estimated the benefits of vaccination, in one case overestimating by 2-fold the number of infections prevented due to extended female catch-up in a high vaccine uptake setting.
Conclusions
An empirical mixing structure more accurately represents sexual mixing survey data, and using the less accurate, yet commonly-used A-P structure has a notable effect on estimates of {HPV} vaccination benefits. This underscores the need for mixing structures that are less dependent on unverified assumptions and are directly informed by sexual behavior data.},

abstract = {The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) has decided to use Bayesian melding as the basis for its probabilistic projections of HIV prevalence in countries with generalized epidemics. This combines a mechanistic epidemiological model, prevalence data, and expert opinion. Initially, the posterior distribution was approximated by sampling-importance-resampling, which is simple to implement, easy to interpret, transparent to users, and gave acceptable results for most countries. For some countries, however, this is not computationally efficient because the posterior distribution tends to be concentrated around nonlinear ridges and can also be multimodal. We propose instead incremental mixture importance sampling (IMIS), which iteratively builds up a better importance sampling function. This retains the simplicity and transparency of sampling importance resampling, but is much more efficient computationally. It also leads to a simple estimator of the integrated likelihood that is the basis for Bayesian model comparison and model averaging. In simulation experiments and on real data, it outperformed both sampling importance resampling and three publicly available generic Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for this kind of problem.},

abstract = {Background. Calibration is the process of estimating parameters of a mathematical model by matching model out- puts to calibration targets. In the presence of nonidentifiability, multiple parameter sets solve the calibration problem, which may have important implications for decision making. We evaluate the implications of nonidentifiability on the optimal strategy and provide methods to check for nonidentifiability. Methods. We illustrate nonidentifiability by calibrating a 3-state Markov model of cancer relative survival (RS). We performed 2 different calibration exer- cises: 1) only including RS as a calibration target and 2) adding the ratio between the 2 nondeath states over time as an additional target. We used the Nelder-Mead (NM) algorithm to identify parameter sets that best matched the calibration targets. We used collinearity and likelihood profile analyses to check for nonidentifiability. We then estimated the benefit of a hypothetical treatment in terms of life expectancy gains using different, but equally good- fitting, parameter sets. We also applied collinearity analysis to a realistic model of the natural history of colorectal cancer. Results. When only RS is used as the calibration target, 2 different parameter sets yield similar maximum likelihood values. The high collinearity index and the bimodal likelihood profile on both parameters demonstrated the presence of nonidentifiability. These different, equally good-fitting parameter sets produce different estimates of the treatment effectiveness (0.67 v. 0.31 years), which could influence the optimal decision. By incorporating the additional target, the model becomes identifiable with a collinearity index of 3.5 and a unimodal likelihood profile. Conclusions. In the presence of nonidentifiability, equally likely parameter estimates might yield different conclusions. Checking for the existence of nonidentifiability and its implications should be incorporated into standard model calibration procedures.},
